Social Media Intelligence

The goal of this project is to identify and link online profiles to a single individual and to attempt to create a mental profile based on 
their posts, likes and dislikes. This mental profile will also have a risk percentage which will give a score to identify if that person
is a risk to themselves or others.  More than likely most people will be identified as a risk, which is why I plan on implementing risk
thresholds. Hypothetically a high risk individual could potentially have targeted posts that will try to put that person in a lower risk
bracket, lets say Person A is a high risk individual and may be sympathizing with extremists, by targeting them with posts about how 
inhumane these extremists may be, person A might then change their opinions to the extremists and will stop sypathizing. This is also
risky, it should be noted this may have an opposite effect, Person A might decide that it's the "Main stream media" painting them in a 
bad light. Situations like this could be circumvented by showing anti-extremist posts to Person B, Person B may be trusted by Person A and 
may post about the inhumanity of said extremists, posts by person B will then be shown to Person A and it could prevent sympthization. 
The mental profile also stated below could be used to identify mental disorders (schizophrenia, depression, sociopathy, etc.) and help
that individual seek help.

Goals:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Link social media accounts to a user

-Use public social media posts to find their most common areas, maybe a heat map

-Use public social media information to find any instance of them on a site like pastebin (find if they've had any further information 
included in leaks)

-Maybe have some sort of searchable database of previously searched information

-Use social media to create a mental profile, find their likes, dislikes, find how they would react to certain things(ways to push buttons)

-Use mental profile to ID mental disorders

-Create a web interface to easily sort through found data and to easily search targets
