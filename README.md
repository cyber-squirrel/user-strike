Social Media Intelligence

So, This is experimental. I want to see how much I can find out about myself just using social media, I'll make it modular so if a user
knows the name of someones facebook account, email, twitter, etc it will find out as much as possible about them.

Goals:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Link social media accounts to a user
-Use public social media posts to find their most common areas, maybe a heat map
-Use public social media information to find any instance of them on a site like pastebin (find if they've had any further information 
included in leaks)
-Maybe have some sort of searchable database of previously searched information
-Use social media to create a mental profile, find their likes, dislikes, find how they would react to certain things(ways to push buttons)
-Use mental profile to ID mental disorders


I am not responsible for how people use this, I'm making a tool to show how we've given up privacy.
